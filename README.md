This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped from [next-starter-strict](https://github.com/kripod/next-starter-strict), built upon:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) for enhanced browser compatibility
  - [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) for style composition, with [babel-plugin-optimize-clsx](https://github.com/merceyz/babel-plugin-optimize-clsx)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for refactoring with confidence
- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), enforced through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistency and clean diffs

Auto-fixes are performed on save with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or by using `npm run fix`.
